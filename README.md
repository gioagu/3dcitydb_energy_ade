3D City Database extension for the CityGML Energy ADE
================

The 3D City Database extension for the CityGML Energy ADE is a free extension to the free and open-source [3D City Database](http://www.3dcitydb.org). It is meant to store, represent, and manage all Energy-ADE-related entities and attributes, building upon the 3D City Database.

The schema of the 3D City Database extension has been derived from the [Energy ADE for CityGML](http://en.wiki.energy.sig3d.org/index.php/Main_Page) and has been realised as PostgreSQL/PostGIS database schema which comes as a collection of SQL scripts.

The 3D City Database Extension for the Energy ADE is being developed by [AIT](https://www.ait.ac.at/en/) - Austrian Institute of Technology, [Center for Energy](https://www.ait.ac.at/en/about-the-ait/center/center-for-energy), [Smart Cities and Regions Research Field](https://www.ait.ac.at/en/research-fields/smart-cities-and-regions).

Documentation
-------------
A complete and comprehensive documentation on the 3D City Database Extension for the Energy ADE is available with the software and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/gioagu/3dcitydb_ade/tree/master/02_energy_ade/manual).

However, the user is encouraged to keep a copy of the 3DCityDB and of the Energy ADE documentation at hand. The 3DCityDB documentation can be accessed on-line [here](https://github.com/3dcitydb/3dcitydb/tree/master/Documentation), while the Energy ADE documentation [here](https://github.com/cstb/citygml-energy/tree/v0.8/doc/guidelines).
Finally, a very useful hands-on tutorial for beginners, where the most important steps to set up the 3DCtyDB and use the Importer/Exporter are described, can be retrieved [here](https://github.com/3dcitydb/tutorials).

More information
----------------
[OGC CityGML](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/citygml) is an open data model and XML-based format for the storage and exchange of semantic 3D city models. It is an application schema for the [Geography Markup Language version 3.1.1 (GML3)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml), the extendible international standard for spatial data exchange issued by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the ISO TC211. The aim of the development of CityGML is to reach a common definition of the basic entities, attributes, and relations of a 3D city model.

CityGML is an international OGC standard and can be used free of charge.
